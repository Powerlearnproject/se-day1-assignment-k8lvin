Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software development is the process of designing, development, testing, deployment and maintainance of software.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
waterfall model - provided the first structured approach to software development.
Agile methodologies - shifted the focus towards flexibility and customer collaboration.
open source software - democratized access to software tools and fostered a culture of collaboration and innovation.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning - defining scope and objective of the project.
Analysis - analyzing the gathered requirements and understanding user needs.
Design - development of architecture and design of the software.
Implementation - writing the actual code and developing the software.
Testing - evaluation of the software to ensure it meets standards and works as intended.
Deployment - releasing the software for use by end users
Maintainance - ongoing support and updates for the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology consists of distinct phases that must be completed before moving to the next eg developing a payroll system while Agile methodology focus on iterative development,flexibility and customer collaboration. eg developing a task management system.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer is responsible for coding,testing and maintaining software applications.
Quality assurance engineer - ensures that the software meets the required software standards and functions correctly.
Project manager ensures a project meets its goals and objectives on time and within budget while also managing the team and communicating with the stakeholders.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide a cohesive environment where developers can code,test,debug and deploy code efficiently. eg visual studio code.
VCS offer robust tools for collaboration,code management and quality assurance. eg Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
keeping up with the rapid technological changes - continuous learning and participate in tech communities to enhance learning.
handling tight deadlines - employ effective time management to maintain productivity without burning out.
maintaining work,life balance - prioritize mental and physical health and establish clear work hours and sticking to them.
managing complexity - implement well known design patterns to solve recurring design problems.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing focuses on individual components or functions of the software.
integration testing focuses on interactions between integrated units or modules.
system testing focuses on the complete and integrated software system.
acceptance testing focuses on the software's compliance with the business requirements and user needs. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is crafting questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from robot or AI Assistance.
prompt engineering optimizes AI performance and ensures reliable and accurate interactions.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt - cook tea.
Improved promt - Explain how to prepare tea using milk, tea leaves as the ingredients.
The improved prompt is effective because it will enable the AI give a better and more datailed response.
