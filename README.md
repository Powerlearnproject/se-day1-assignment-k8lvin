Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software development is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
waterfall model - provided the first structured approach to software development.
Agile methodologies - shifted the focus towards flexibility and customer collaboration.
open source software - democratized access to software tools and fostered a culture of collaboration and innovation.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface. 
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall e.g. developing a payroll system while Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to changes e.g a task management system.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer is responsible for coding, testing and maintaining software solutions.
Quality assurance engineer - ensures software quality by designing and executing software plans.
Project manager overseas the planning execution and delivery of software projects



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide a cohesive environment where developers can code,test,debug and deploy code efficiently. eg visual studio code.
Version control systems track changes to source code and coordinating work among team members.  E.g. Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
keeping up with the rapid technological changes - continuous learning and participate in tech communities to enhance learning.
handling tight deadlines - employ effective time management to maintain productivity without burning out.
maintaining work,life balance - prioritize mental and physical health and establish clear work hours and sticking to them.
managing complexity - implement well known design patterns to solve recurring design problems.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing focuses on individual components or functions of the software.
integration testing focuses on interactions between integrated units or modules.
system testing focuses on the complete and integrated software system.
acceptance testing focuses on the software's compliance with the business requirements and user needs. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is crafting questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from robot or AI Assistance.
prompt engineering optimizes AI performance and ensures reliable and accurate interactions.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt - cook tea.
Improved promt - Explain how to prepare tea using milk, tea leaves as the ingredients.
The improved prompt is effective because it will enable the AI give a better and more datailed response.
